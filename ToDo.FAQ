A few items which could go into a FAQ:

What do the error messages mean?
Why is my formula positioned awkardly within the text? (most probably displaymath instead of inline math)
Why are limits over sums and similar not correctly set? (use displaymath, sometimes `\\limits`)
Why don't my special characters like (unicode) math symbols or umlauts not work
