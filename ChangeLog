1.6.1 - bug fix release
    -    set css class correctly for display math formulas
    -    HTML label/id generation:
        -    do not create overlong id's
        -    do only generate id's starting with an alphabetical character
        -    squeeze multiple identical characters
    -    reparse outsourced formulas correctly (was a mixture of formatted vs.
        unformatted formulas)

1.6 - complete rewrite
    - rewrite GladTeX fully in Python
        - allows easy compilation into a binary for a specific platform
        - comes with a new library to use GladTeX functionality within other
          applications
        - fully unit-tested
    - enable piping support; GladTeX can read from stdin and write to stdout
    - drop -t switch; image is either transparent by default or has a background
      color which can be set with -b
    - drop -s switch
    - introduce -o (output) option
    - introduce new cache format containing version numbers; json, so
      interchangeable between programming languages

1.5 - Introduce options to make embedding of GladTeX easier
    - Try to parse LaTeX's error output and display it to help users to find the
      issue quicker and to make GladTeX better embeddable.
    - Add option to remove error log file, produced by LaTeX, automatically.
    - Rewrite some help messages.
    - Add signal handling to get meaningful error messages if GladTeX hangs.

1.4.2 - bug fix release
    - Add some eval's to cope with some failures.
    - Since there were some incompatibilities between Perl 5.10 and 5.18 in how
      the cache of the generated images is stored, GladTeX now removes this file
      along with all images starting with "eqn" and generates them again.

1.4.1 - bug fix release
    - Remove desc.html if created and empty

1.4 - put LaTeX equations into alt tag for text-mode browsers and blind people
      (and disabled images)
    - If requested (-a), exclude equations longer than 80 characters in an extra
      file and make the equation image a link to the longer, excluded image
      alternative
    - eqn2img: patch to allow building on windows
    - Change build system from make to cmake
    - Refactored gladtex code a lot to allow the usage of "use strict/use
      warnings"
    - Fix bug where multiple equations couldn't be on a single (html) line
    - Rework manpage

1.3 - Un-escape common entities before processing equations
    - Update man page with CSS class options
    - Add support for setting the CSS class of images when the
      environment is "math" or "displaymath"
    - eqn2img: changed redirection syntax (from dvips to /dev/null)
      for portability
    - GladTeX: exit with status 1 when a closing EQ tag is missing
    - GladTeX: print error messages to stderr instead of stdout
    - Fix environment-passing to eqn2img
    - Add support for a "dpi" attribute on EQ tags to customize the
      DPI used for each equation

1.2 - Fixed a serious memory allocation error, pointed out by Eric J.
      Francois. Also fixed several leaks.
    - Added full alpha channel to PNG files (also suggested by Eric)
    - The -e option was ignored, fixed (pointed out by Andr\'e Schleife)
    - Added man page, contributed by Volker Schatz

1.1 - Portability fixes: Do not assume a specific location for perl
      (use "env" in the shebang line) and do not rely on the bash style
      "&>" redirection.

1.0 - Image alignment workaround (most browsers interpret
      "ALIGN=MIDDLE" somewhat strangely, so it has been changed
      to "STYLE=vertical-align: -xx")
    - Added cache file, so that gladtex doesn't have to regenerate
      images for equations that haven't changed.
    - Added ENV option (as in <EQ ENV=align*>) to support environments
      other than "displaymath".
    - Bug fixes.
 
0.3 - Added BoundingBox workaround (dvips sometimes outputs wrong
      BoundingBox, for instance when using \mathbb{})
    - Moved the whole "LaTeX eqn to image" conversion into the C code,
      turning  the C program (renamed from pngmodify to eqn2img) into
      a standalone utility (e.g. echo '\sqrt{2}' | eqn2img -o
      eqn.png).
    - Added colour options (-c -b and -t).
    - Fixed bug causing segfault when adding space _above_ an image.
    - Fixed image reusing bug (in 0.2 image reuse didn't work across
      separate files when processing files outside startup cwd).
    - And some other minor bugs and cosmetic changes.
    - Makefile added to distribution

0.2 - First official release, completely rewritten code.

0.1 - Used only internally at the Dept. of Mathematics at the Univ. of Oslo
      July-August 1999 (for the project "Matteknekker'n") under the name
      htmleqn.
